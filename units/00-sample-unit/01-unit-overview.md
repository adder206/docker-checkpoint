### !instructor

<!-- Note:  Remove this instructor tag if you are past phase one of a migration/creation -->

## Topic Content

This section should contain a high level overview of all of the content that students will encounter in a lecture, which serves as a reference point for them - any subsequent files should be a walkthrough of a project that will serve as a supplemental resource, still following an "I do, we do, you do" structure.

### !end-instructor

## Check for Understanding

A check for understanding should happen at the end of this reading so that students have a chance to reflect on the content they have seen - this is not a replacement for a checkpoint.
